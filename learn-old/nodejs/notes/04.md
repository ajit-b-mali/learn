# Questions

- What is JSON ?
- What is package.json ?
- what is package-lock.json ?
- What is npm ?
- what is `-g`, `--save-dev` ?
- How are versions are managed ?
- developement vs production ?

# Understanding npm scripts

- `npm init` - initialize a node project
- which prompt for -- 
```console
package name: (http-server)
version: (1.0.0)
description: http server with Node.js
entry point: (index.js) server.js
test command:
git repository:
keywords:
author: Ajit Mali
license: (ISC)
```
- and create a `package.json` - a configuration file
- see [code](../projects/http-server/package.json)

## package.json["script"]

- this consist scripts
- there are built in scripts
    - test
    - start
    - install
    - `npm script-name` -- to run inbuilt scripts
    - ex -- `npm start`
- we can add custom scripts
    - start-server
    - `npm run script-name` -- to run custom script
    - ex -- `npm start-server`

# Installing 3rd party packages

- `npm install <package-name>` --> installs third party packages - default to production dependencies
- `npm install <package-name> --save-dev` --> add to developement dependencies
- `npm install <package-name> --save` --> add to production dependencies
- `npm install <package-name> -g` --> add to global scope so don't need to re-install for every project
- `npm install` --> go to `package.json` and install specified packages

- after installation a package
    - installed package can be found under node-module folder
    - package-lock.json file created
    - package.json updated

# nodemon

- it is a utility

# Extras

## Errors

1. Syntax error - mistake in typing - compiler specify them -- easy
2. Runtime error - will compile but fail at runtime -- medium
3. Logical error - will compile and run fine but doesn't get expected output -- hard

# ABBR

- npm - Node Package Manager

# Note

- can not name script with run
- we need to restart the server everytime we make change
- can not name project with a built in package name
- can see about package on npm <package-name> website
- .gitingore node-package folder
