## Time Complexity

> Time complexity refers to the growth of the running steps increasing with the input size.

1. Constant Time - O(1)
2. Logarithmic Time - O(log n)
3. Linear Time - O(n)
4. Linearithmic Time - O(n log n)
5. Quadratic Time - O(n^2)
6. Exponential Time - O(2^n)
7. Factorial Time - O(n!)

## Space Complexity

> Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.
